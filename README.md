# Astro in Python

Practical introductions to Python modules used in Astronomy and Astrophysics.

## Getting started

To download the worksheets, you can either use git to clone this repository, or download the notes as a zipped file directly via the link on the side of this page.

Don't know git? Here's a brief [tutorial introduction](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). For installation instructions on your operating system of choice, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

If you don't have Python installed, the Anaconda distribution provides everything you need to get started, including common science and engineering packages. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to download and install it on your operating system.

This course uses interactive Jupyter notebooks. If you use the Anaconda distribution, then Jupyter is already installed. If not, installation instructions are provided [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html). Once installed, to start the notebook server type the following in to your terminal/CMD prompt:

    jupyter notebook

This should open a tab in your browser. If you've run it in the course directory you will be able to launch the notebooks from the *notebook* folder. Otherwise, navigate to the course directory through the browser interface. Additional server options are detailed [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/running.html). 


## Updates

This repository represents a living document. Changes may be made at any time. The easiest way to stay up to date with the latest changes is to clone or fork the repository and pull any changes (If you are unfamiliar with the terms 'clone' and 'fork', see the *Getting Started* section for introductory links to Git).

## Credit

In producing this content I've taken a lot of inspiration from other courses on similar packages or topics. The documentation for all of the packages has also been an invaluable resource.

In particular, [python4vienna](https://github.com/astrofrog/python4vienna) and the [Astropy documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) have been particularly inspiring, and I thank the respective authors.

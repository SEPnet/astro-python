  "body": "## About\r\n\r\n*Astro in Python* is a one stop shop for introductions to Python modules used in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Topics are presented as [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, that can be viewed online, or downloaded locally and interacted with.\r\n\r\nIt is currently a work in progress.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nYou can view the notebooks on Github using the link above.\r\n\r\nTo download the notebooks, either use git to clone the repository, or download the notes as a zipped file directly via the link above.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Git\r\nDon't know git? Here's a brief [tutorial introduction](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). For installation instructions on your operating system of choice, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Python\r\nIf you don't have Python installed, the Anaconda distribution provides everything you need to get started, including common science and engineering packages. Follow the instructions [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to download and install it on your operating system.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Jupyter\r\nThis course uses interactive Jupyter notebooks. If you use the Anaconda distribution, then Jupyter is already installed. If not, installation instructions are provided here. Once installed, to start the notebook server type the following in to your terminal/CMD prompt:\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should open a tab in your browser. If you've run it in the course directory you will be able to launch the notebooks from the notebook folder. Otherwise, navigate to the course directory through the browser interface. Additional server options are detailed [here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/running.html).\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nThe following notebooks are currently available. The modules covered are attached in brackets.\r\n\r\n- Handling FITS files (astropy)\r\n- Units (astropy)\r\n- Tables (astropy)\r\n- Plotting (aplpy)\r\n- Celestial Coordinates (astropy)\r\n- Modeling (astropy)\r\n- Convolution (astropy)\r\n- Cosmology (astropy)\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nThis repository represents a living document. Changes may be made at any time. The easiest way to stay up to date with the latest changes is to clone or fork the repository and pull any changes (If you are unfamiliar with the terms 'clone' and 'fork', see the *Getting Started* section below for introductory links to Git).\r\n\r\nIf your favourite module isn't represented, either let me know by [raising an issue](https://github.com/polyphant1/astro-python/issues/new), or email me directly (contact details below). Or create your own introduction and raise a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the author via the contact details below.\r\n\r\n*Christopher Lovell: c.lovell_at_sussex.ac.uk*\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for content, or notice any errors in the scripts, you can either let me know by email or, preferably, fork this repo, make the change, then make a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nSupported by the South East Physics Network (SEPnet)\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n[![SEPnet](http://www.sepnet.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SEPnetLogo.png)](http://www.sepnet.ac.uk/)\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The documentation for all of the packages has also been an invaluable resource.\r\n\r\nIn particular, [python4vienna](https://github.com/astrofrog/python4vienna) and the [Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) documentation have been particularly inspiring, and I thank the respective authors.\r\n\r\n",

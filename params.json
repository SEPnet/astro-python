  "body": "## About\r\n\r\n*Astro in Python* is a one stop shop for introductions to Python modules used in Astronomy and Astrophysics. \r\n\r\nIt is currently a work in progress.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nTo download the worksheets, you can either use git to clone this repository, or download the notes as a zipped file directly via the link on the side of this page.\r\n\r\nDon't know git? Here's a brief tutorial introduction. For installation instructions on your operating system of choice, follow the instructions here.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Python installed, the Anaconda distribution provides everything you need to get started, including common science and engineering packages. Follow the instructions here to download and install it on your operating system.\r\n\r\nThis course uses interactive Jupyter notebooks. If you use the Anaconda distribution, then Jupyter is already installed. If not, installation instructions are provided here. Once installed, to start the notebook server type the following in to your terminal/CMD prompt:\r\n\r\n```\r\njupyter notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should open a tab in your browser. If you've run it in the course directory you will be able to launch the notebooks from the notebook folder. Otherwise, navigate to the course directory through the browser interface. Additional server options are detailed here.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\n\r\nThe following notebooks are currently available. The modules covered are attached in brackets.\r\n\r\n- Handling FITS files (astropy)\r\n- Units (astropy)\r\n- Tables (astropy)\r\n- Plotting (aplpy)\r\n- Celestial Coordinates (astropy)\r\n- Modeling (astropy)\r\n- Convolution (astropy)\r\n- Cosmology (astropy)\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\nThis repository represents a living document. Changes may be made at any time. The easiest way to stay up to date with the latest changes is to clone or fork the repository and pull any changes (If you are unfamiliar with the terms 'clone' and 'fork', see the *Getting Started* section below for introductory links to Git).\r\n\r\nIf your favourite module isn't represented, either let me know by [raising an issue](https://github.com/polyphant1/astro-python/issues/new), or email me directly (contact details below). Or create your own introduction and raise a pull request!\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact the author via the contact details below.\r\n\r\n*Christopher Lovell: c.lovell_at_sussex.ac.uk*\r\n\r\nIf you have suggestions for content, or notice any errors in the scripts, you can either let me know by email or, preferably, fork this repo, make the change, then make a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\n### Credit\r\n\r\nIn producing this content I've taken inspiration from other courses on similar packages or topics. The documentation for all of the packages has also been an invaluable resource.\r\n\r\nIn particular, [python4vienna](https://github.com/astrofrog/python4vienna) and the [Astropy](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/) documentation have been particularly inspiring, and I thank the respective authors.\r\n\r\nSupported by the South East Physics Network (SEPnet)\r\n\r\n<center>[![SEPnet](http://www.sepnet.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SEPnetLogo.png)](http://www.sepnet.ac.uk/)</center>",
